# Introduction:
The idea come about during one of my modules in ethical hacking. Where there are many online tools to help with reconnaissance, so I thought it will be a good idea to create a web extension that help to automate common recon searches.

# How to use:
When you are on the website that you want to perform the recon, click on the infoweb extension and choose the tool you want to perform the search with, or click on the `Search all` button to search with all the current web tools.

### Example:
![Sample.gif](/imgGit/sample.gif)

# Disclaimer:
Please do not use this extension for any illegal purposes.

# Notes:
This extension is not monitored and maintained for bugs, as this is only a side project to me. But feel free to create a pull request if you have any improvements or add-ons.

Currently, not added in Firefox addons.mozilla.org yet.

Plan to add an input field, so you don't have to visit the targeted site to quarry.
